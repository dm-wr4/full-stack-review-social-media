- app.post('/auth/register', authCtrl.register) - receives email and password on req.body. Runs db.check_user. if user found returns 409 ‘User already exists’. If no user found, hashes password with bcrypt and runs db.register_user, puts user on session and returns user. 

- app.delete('/auth/logout', authCtrl.logout) - destroys session. returns status 200

- app.get('/auth/user', authCtrl.getUser) - checks if there is a user on session: if there is returns users. if no user on session returns 404.
